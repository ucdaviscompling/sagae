Thank you for your interest in applying to UC Davis! I supervise
graduate students in the Linguistics prorgam and in the 
Computer Science program. The only way to join my lab as a UC Davis
graduate student is to apply directly to these graduate programs.
I cannot evaluate applications outside of the regular admissions
process. Please do not send me your materials by email. If you have a 
question about my research or about UC Davis, please feel free to 
contact me. If you simply want to let me know you are applying, there
is no need to contact me. In the application, you will have an opportunity
to list faculty members you are interested in working with at
UC Davis. If you select me, I will see your application during the 
admissions process.

Q: How likely is it that I will be admitted?
<br>A: I cannot answer that. The only way to have your application evaluated
for admission is to apply.
